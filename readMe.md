#Day 37 of 100 days coding challenge

#this actually took me 2 days to complete, after the course I planned on creating a GUI or Interface for Pixe.la where I can create more graphs and adding pixels.
#really like the idea of this tracker, I have left some notes regarding on what I will be implementing in the future to make this a better app

#Thanks for checking this out, send me a DM @Agurto_Miguel on Twitter or create a pull request to help me develop this app.
