This actually took me 2 days to complete, after the course I planned on creating a GUI or Interface for Pixe.la where I can create more graphs and adding pixels.
Really like the idea of this tracker, I have left some notes regarding on what I will be implementing in the future to make this a better app

Thanks for checking this out, send me a DM on [![alt text][1.2]][1] or create a pull request to help me develop this app.
